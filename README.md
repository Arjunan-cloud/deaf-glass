# Smart glasses for blind             

- ##  Project Aims

  In today's fast-paced world, effective communication is key to participation in various social, educational, and professional settings. For individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing, navigating environments without subtitles can present significant challenges. Our innovative solution, Smart Glasses, aims to bridge this communication gap by converting spoken language into real-time subtitles, directly displayed on the lens. This groundbreaking technology leverages advanced speech-to-text algorithms and a sleek, wearable design, ensuring that users never miss a moment. Join us on this journey to enhance accessibility and inclusivity for the deaf community.




 




-  ## What's the project? 
Smart glasses for the deaf convert spoken words into real-time subtitles, enhancing communication and social integration. They use advanced speech recognition and AR technology. The innovation holds promise for education, employment, and social interactions, highlighting ethical considerations and ongoing research for improved accuracy, accessibility, and affordability.
   
-  ##  How it work?
 Here's a simplified explanation of how smart glasses for the deaf work:

1. **Microphone**: The smart glasses are equipped with a microphone that picks up spoken words from the surrounding environment.

2. **Speech Recognition**: The captured audio is sent to a speech recognition system, which converts the spoken words into text using advanced algorithms.

3. **Augmented Reality (AR)**: The converted text is then displayed on the lenses of the smart glasses using augmented reality technology. This allows the text to appear as if it is floating in front of the user’s eyes.

4. **Real-Time Processing**: All of this processing happens in real-time, ensuring that the subtitles are displayed immediately as the words are spoken.

This seamless integration of speech recognition and AR technology enables individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing to read the spoken words directly on the lenses, enhancing their ability to communicate and interact in various social, educational, and professional settings.
